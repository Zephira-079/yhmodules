## Tired of Removing And Waiting Occlusion in Unity?

- Well i'm also tired, so i made this
- place this inside "yourprojectname"/Library
- then place the app.py (not the unity_occlusion folder lol)
- make sure the Occlusion folder is also in the root folder or just read my shitty code
- make sure you know what threading is or else i don't know xd
- then execute it on your terminal 
- python app.py
